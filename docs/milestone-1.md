Mix Masters

# Application Idea

The idea behind this project is that we will provide users with a large list of possible alcoholic beverages, and detailed instructions on how to make them (ie, their recipes which tell required ingredients and steps on how to make it). The drinks themselves will be listed, and be able to be clicked on to show the recipe.

Not only this, but the application will also provide a calculator that will take from users their volume of various ingredients, and return a list of recipes that they have the proper ingredients to make.

These ingredients will also be listed on the sight, along with their usual prices, which will be gathered with some research from local websites that sell them and taking a rough average of them. They will be sourced and credited.

Lastly, there will be a rating system, in which under each recipe, users can write their rating (1-5 stars), and possibly comments, and the average rating, along with number of ratings, will be displayed.
