This is the first thing you see when you enter the site. It displays information about the app, credits to the team, a prompt asking users which service they'd like to use, and an image of alcohol to flesh out the page.

This is what the user sees when they click on "Recipe Menu". It replaces the original image with a menu of recipes, which are organized in a list that can be browsed with the previous and next buttons. Currently there are 3 drinks, to display that the list can loop in both directions, which can be seen in the provided video. This list will eventually have a much larger amount of items in it.

Lastly, I've provided a pic of the other service, the drink calculator. This is still in very early development, but once finished, it will provide something very similar to the menu except with a filter that the user can personalize / customize by filtering drinks that they don't have the required ingredients for. Likewise to the recipe menu, there will be a list of drinks returned to them that they can loop through and browse via a previous and next button. Note that The buttons "Recipe Menu" and "Drink Calculator" change in a visually pleasing stylistic way, thanks to bootstrap providing classes for the buttons. Likewise, the two functions will have different visualistic styles to greater emphasize they are different, such as the aqua background here.
